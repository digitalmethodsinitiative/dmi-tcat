# DMI TCAT
![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat/workflows/Docker%20Image%20CI/badge.svg)

The Digital Methods Initiative Twitter Capture and Analysis Toolset (DMI-TCAT) allows one to retrieve and collect tweets from Twitter and to analyze them in various ways.

## Installation

You can find detailed installation instructions in the [wiki](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat/wiki/Installation-Guide)

### Requirements
- Twitter API credentials (these can be obtained from https://apps.twitter.com)
- One of the following Linux distributions:
  - Ubuntu 18.04
  - Debian 9.*
- ... or Docker (experimental)

### Debian and Ubuntu

Run:
````
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat/master/helpers/tcat-install-linux.sh | sudo bash
````

### Docker
This Docker image uses a modified version of the installer (helpers/tcat-install-linux.sh) as a shortcut for easy deployment with docker.
1. Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat.git`

2. Add your Twitter token and key as well as any other needed information to the config file located here: `./docker/config`
```
# Update at minimum
CONSUMERKEY=
CONSUMERSECRET=
USERTOKEN=
USERSECRET=
```
Note: if you intend on using a port other than 80, update `SERVERNAME=localhost` to include the port (e.g. `SERVERNAME=localhost:4000`)
3. Build the image:
`docker image build --progress=plain -t tcat:1.0 .`
- The `--progress=plain` tag ensure you can see all the output; important if your config file does not include passwords and they are auto generated.
4. Run a container with the image:
`docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name tcat tcat:1.0`
5. In the future, you can stop and start your TCAT container with:
`docker stop tcat`
and
`docker start tcat`
